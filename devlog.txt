Jadon 3   Refined navbar. Text is now in centre, is spaced evenly. READY FOR TEXT STYLING.
Jadon 4   Began styling of text. Edited weight & added hover. *must add functionality for
          clicking link when not pointing to text
Jadon 5   Rehauled CSS. Made "mobile-mode" priority. Website will now correctly go into mobile mode.
